# Capstone-1 - Olympics Analysis

###Project Summary
The purpose of this project is to gather insights from the past Olympic Summer Events. 
We will be able to identify the following:
* Identifying number of participants in each event
* Identifying the countries that excels in the selected sport
* Medal Ranking By Country
* Insights on whether age will affect the chance of winning a medal

#Data Selection
In this analysis, we will be focusing on 6 different sports, and categorized based on the cardio intensity.

#Dashboard Slicers

The dashboard consist of slicers that allow us to filter based on:
* Year
* Region
* Cardio Intensity
* Sport
* Gender

#Visuals - Number Of Participants

Since 1980, number of olympic participants is uptrending, which suggests that olympics has becoming more popular and competitive

#Total Number Of Medals By Country

We are able to identify the top performers based on country, and the distribution of medal(Gold,Silver,Bronze). For top 3 , we have USA, Russia and Germany for the sports that we have selected.

#Participants and Medals By Sports

With these visuals, we are able to identify the number of participants and medals available in a particular sport. For Athletics and Swimming, they both have way more participants than the other sports.

#Medalist and Age Group

From these visuals, we are able to identify that the majority of the medalist are from the age between 19 to 30 years old, and we see a huge decline after 30.
This could suggest that the age group 19 - 30 years old can be considered the 'optimal age'. In order to validate this claim, we will be using the Cardio Intensity slicer to gather insights.

#Visuals - High Cardio Intensity Participants and Medalists
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34051347/119299897-62934d80-bc92-11eb-849e-821e11f2727d.png)
Majority of the participants are from the 19-30 age group, likewise for the medalist. We see a huge decline of participants after the 36 years old. This suggests that age group is an important factor for having a shot at the medal.

#Visuals - Medium Cardio Intensity Participants and Medalists
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34051347/119300074-baca4f80-bc92-11eb-834c-4fcf0e574851.png)
For the medium cardio intensity, we see some similarity in the age groups, which majority still comes from 19 - 30 years old age group. But here, we do see more participants that are from the 30+ age group, as well as medalists. This suggests that for medium cardio intensity sports like badminton and table tennis, age is likely to be a less important factor compared to the high intensity sports.

#Visuals - Low Cardio Intensity Participants and Medalist

Lastly, we will look at the low cardio intensity sports, which consists of archery and shooting. From the visuals, we gather that the age group for the low intensity sports are more evenly distributed, for both participants and medalists. From here, we can say that  there are probably more important factors than the age factor, on having a chance to win a medal,such as years of experience/training.

#Summary
Judging on the distribution of participants and medalists across the three levels of sport cardio intensity, we see a correlation that for low intensity sports, participants and medalists are more evenly distributed, whereas for high intensity sports, we see a concentration of participants and medalists around the 19-30 age group. In conclusion, we can say that for high and medium intensity sports, age plays a vital role on having a chance to participant and win a medal. As Summer Olympics occurs every 4 years, the participants actually have a very small window of opportunity, due to the "optimal age" based on the insights we have seen from the visuals.
